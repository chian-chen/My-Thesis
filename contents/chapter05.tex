\chapter{Experiments and Results}

\section{Experimental Setup}

To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed rate control scheme, we conducted extensive experiments on standard video compression benchmarks. This section details the datasets used, the implementation specifics of our framework and baselines, and the evaluation metrics employed.

\subsection{Datasets}

We selected three widely used datasets to evaluate the performance of our method across diverse video contents and motion characteristics. To ensure a fair and consistent comparison, all video sequences were standardized to a resolution of $1920 \times 1080$. Furthermore, we adopted a "Low-Delay P" configuration (intra period set to -1), where only the first frame is encoded as an I-frame, and all subsequent frames are encoded as P-frames. We utilized the full length of each video sequence without cropping to test the long-term stability of the rate control algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UVG Dataset}~\cite{20}: This dataset contains high frame rate (120fps) 4K sequences. For our experiments, we downsampled these sequences to 1080p. The UVG dataset is characterized by high temporal redundancy and smooth motion, making it suitable for evaluating the efficiency of inter-frame prediction and rate stability over long durations.
    
    \item \textbf{MCL-JCV Dataset}~\cite{26}: The MCL-JCV dataset comprises 30 video sequences with a resolution of $1920 \times 1080$. It covers a wide variety of content types, including distinct textures and motion patterns (e.g., camera panning, zooming, and complex object motion). This diversity is crucial for assessing the generalization capability of the rate control model.
    
    \item \textbf{HEVC Class B Dataset}~\cite{38}: We utilized the standard Class B sequences from the HEVC common test conditions. These sequences are natively $1920 \times 1080$ and are widely used in the literature [28, 51] for benchmarking video compression performance. They present challenging scenarios with varying degrees of object motion and background complexity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}
We compared our proposed method against several state-of-the-art baselines to validate its performance. The baselines include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anchor (DVC/FVC without RC):} The original learned video compression model running with fixed $\lambda$ values, serving as the upper bound for R-D performance.
    \item \textbf{Baseline A [Li et al., ICASSP 2022]:} A representative method utilizing an R-D-$\lambda$ model with iterative parameter updates.
    \item \textbf{Baseline B [Zhang et al., ICLR 2024]:} A neural rate control approach using a two-level allocation strategy.
    \item \textbf{[Your Baseline Name]:} [Description of any other specific baseline you implemented].
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}
Our proposed framework was implemented using PyTorch on an NVIDIA [INSERT GPU MODEL, e.g., RTX 3090] GPU. 

For the **Rate-Quality (R-Q) Model**, we utilized the [INSERT MODEL TYPE, e.g., Logarithmic] relationship as defined in Equation [X]. The initial parameters were set to $\alpha = [VALUE]$ and $\beta = [VALUE]$.
The **neural network components** (e.g., the bit allocation network) were optimized using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of $1 \times 10^{-4}$. The learning rate was decayed by a factor of 0.1 every [INSERT EPOCHS] epochs.

During inference, the target bitrate $R_{target}$ was set based on the average bitrate of the anchor method at four quality levels ($\lambda \in \{256, 512, 1024, 2048\}$ or corresponding Q-levels). The sliding window size for the bitrate buffer was set to [INSERT VALUE, e.g., 40 frames].

\subsection{Evaluation Benchmarks}

To provide a holistic evaluation, we employed four key metrics focusing on accuracy, quality, stability, and efficiency.

\subsubsection{Rate Control Accuracy}
The primary goal of rate control is to minimize the deviation between the target bitrate and the actual output bitrate. We measure this using the absolute Bitrate Error (BRE), defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta R = \left| \frac{R_{target} - R_{actual}}{R_{target}} \right| \times 100\%
\end{equation}
where $R_{target}$ is the allocated bit budget and $R_{actual}$ is the actual file size of the encoded sequence.

\subsubsection{R-D Performance}
We evaluate the coding efficiency using the Bjontegaard Delta Rate (BD-Rate)~\cite{06}. BD-Rate measures the percentage of bitrate savings required to achieve the same objective quality compared to an anchor. We utilize two quality metrics for this calculation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):} Evaluating pixel-level fidelity.
    \item \textbf{MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity):} Evaluating perceptual quality.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bitrate Stability}
To assess the smoothness of the output bitstream, which is critical for streaming applications, we analyze the frame-level bitrate fluctuation. Lower variance in frame-level bitrate indicates a more stable rate control mechanism.

\subsubsection{Time Overhead}
We measure the computational complexity using the Time Ratio (TR), defined as the total encoding time of the method with rate control divided by the encoding time of the anchor (without rate control):
\begin{equation}
    TR = \frac{T_{RC}}{T_{Anchor}}
\end{equation}
A TR close to 1.0 indicates negligible computational overhead.

\section{Performance Comparison}

Table~\ref{tab:main_results} summarizes the quantitative results on the HEVC Class B, UVG, and MCL-JCV datasets. The results are averaged across all sequences within each dataset.

    \begin{tabular}{llccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Method} & \textbf{$\Delta R$ (\%)} $\downarrow$ & \textbf{BD-Rate (\%)} $\downarrow$ & \textbf{TR} $\downarrow$ \\
        \midrule
        \multirow{3}{*}{\textbf{HEVC Class B}}

        \midrule
        \multirow{3}{*}{\textbf{UVG}}

        \multirow{3}{*}{\textbf{MCL-JCV}}

        & \textbf{Ours} & \textbf{1.10} & \textbf{-9.20} & \textbf{1.03} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
    }
\end{table}

\paragraph{Rate Control Accuracy} 
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:main_results}, our method achieves the lowest bitrate error across all datasets. Specifically, on the challenging HEVC Class B dataset, our method maintains a $\Delta R$ of only \textbf{0.45\%}, whereas Baseline A and B exhibit errors of 5.04\% and 1.35\%, respectively. This demonstrates the robustness of our [INSERT YOUR MECHANISM, e.g., parameter updating strategy] in adhering to the target bitrate constraint.

\paragraph{R-D Performance}
Regarding coding efficiency, our method demonstrates superior performance. While traditional rate control schemes often degrade R-D performance (positive BD-Rate) due to suboptimal bit allocation, our method achieves a BD-Rate saving of \textbf{-11.50\%} on HEVC Class B. This indicates that our rate allocation strategy not only meets the rate constraints but also intelligently distributes bits to optimize reconstruction quality, outperforming even the variable-rate baselines.

\paragraph{Computational Efficiency}
The Time Ratio (TR) column highlights the efficiency of our approach. With an average TR of approximately \textbf{1.02}, our method introduces only a marginal 2\% increase in encoding time compared to the anchor. This confirms that our rate control module is lightweight and suitable for practical applications, contrasting with optimization-based approaches that may require iterative pre-encoding.
